I am a second-year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying computer science, where I am also an undergraduate researcher at [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu), working with [Professor Pieter Abbeel](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/) and [Professor Deepak Pathak](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pathak/). Earlier, I was very fortunate to work with [Professor Zhuowen Tu](http://pages.ucsd.edu/~ztu) on 3D generative modeling as a high school researcher at UCSD. <br>

My research interests include reinforcement learning, robotics, and computer vision. Currently I'm interested in agent-agnostic learning and building general-purpose controllers for robotics.

In my free time, I am also an enthusiastic violinist and a passionate photographer. You can view some of the photos I took [here](https://500px.com/huangwl18).
